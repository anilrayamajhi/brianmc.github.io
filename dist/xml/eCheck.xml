	<title>eCheck.Net</title>
	<para>eCheck.Net® is Authorize.Net's exclusive electronic check processing solution. eCheck.Net enables Web merchants already processing credit card transactions through the Authorize.Net Payment Gateway to offer their customers an additional payment option.</para>
	<para>An eCheck transaction is similar to a credit card transaction because it uses the createTransactionRequest function. The difference is that for an eCheck transaction, the paymentType element contains  a bankAccount section instead of creditCard. The eCheck fields include:</para>
	<itemizedList>
		<listItem><para>accountNumber – The bank account number, masked.</para></listItem>
		<listItem><para>routingNumber - Bank's routing number.</para></listItem>
		<listItem><para>nameOnAccount - Name of the person who holds the bank account.</para></listItem>
		<listItem><para>bankName -The name of the bank</para></listItem>
		<listItem><para>echeckType - The type of eCheck transaction, including ARC, BOC, CCD, PPD, TEL, and WEB. These types are explained in the next section.</para></listItem>
		<listItem><para>checkNumber - The check number as printed on the physical check. Required for ARC and BOC.</para></listItem>
	</itemizedList>
	<para>One other crucial difference between an eCheck and Credit Card payment is that unlike Credit Card payments, eCheck payments are not instantly authorized. The authorization process can take 5 to 7 days.</para>
	<para>eCheck transactions can also be used as a payment type when charging customer profiles. In this case, the eCheck payment information is used in the createCustomerPaymentProfileRequest method. For a list of the API fields used in when charging customer profiles, see the API Reference section <ulink url="http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/#charge-customer-profiles">Charging Customer Profiles</ulink>.</para>
	<para>Below is a code sample of the banking block of the createTransactionRequest. For a code sample of the entire request, see the <ulink url="http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/">API Reference Guide</ulink>.</para>

<para><subtitle>Understanding eCheck Types</subtitle></para>
<para><emphasis>Accounts Receivable Conversion (ARC)</emphasis></para>
<para>This transaction type is a one-time charge against a customer's checking account. ARC allows merchants to collect payments received in the mail or left in a drop-box, and convert them to an electronic payment. When you use this eCheck type, NACHA requires that you use a Magnetic Ink Character Recognition Reader to provide proof of a paper check.</para> 
<para><subtitle>Back Office Conversion (BOC)</subtitle></para>
<para>This transaction type is a one-time charge against a customer's checking account. BOC allows merchants to collect a check written at a point of sale (checkout counter, manned bill payment location, service call location) and convert it to an ACH debit during back office processing. When you use this eCheck type, NACHA requires that you use a Magnetic Ink Character Recognition Reader to provide proof of a paper check.</para>
<para><subtitle>Cash Concentration or Disbursement (CCD)</subtitle></para>
<para>This transaction type is a one-time or recurring charge or refund against a business checking account. CCD transactions are fund transfers to or from a corporate entity.</para>
<para><subtitle>Prearranged Payment and Deposit Entry (PPD)</subtitle></para>
<para>This transaction type is a one-time or recurring charge or refund against a consumer  checking or savings account. PPD transactions may only be originated when payment and deposit terms between the merchant and the customer are prearranged.</para>
<para><subtitle>Telephone-Initiated Entry (TEL)</subtitle></para>
<para>This transaction type is a one-time charge against a consumer checking or savings account that was originated by telephone. TEL transactions can only be originated when an existing relationship between the merchant and the customer exists; or if no relationship exists, the customer must initiate the telephone call to the merchant.</para>
<para><subtitle>Internet-Initiated Entry (WEB)</subtitle></para>
