    <h2>Credit Card Process</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Connecting a Web site to the payment processing networks is exceptionally difficult and typically beyond the expertise and technical resources of most online merchants. Instead, merchants can connect to the Authorize.Net Payment Gateway, which provides

                retail world; however, Authorize.Net uses the Internet instead of a phone line. See our <a href="http://www.authorize.net/resources/howitworksdiagram/">credit card processing diagram</a>.</p>

    <h2>Life of a transaction</h2>

        <p>An online payment transaction goes through various phases, shown below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Authorize</h3>
            </li>
            
            <p>An authorization places a hold on the transaction amount in the consumer’s issuing bank. No money actually changes hands yet. Let’s say the merchant is going to ship a physical product from their website. First they authorize the amount of the
                transaction. Then they ship the product. Only after the product is shipped does the merchant capture the transaction.</p>

            <li>
                <h3>Capture</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Once the product is shipped, the merchant can capture an amount up to the amount of the authorization. Usually the full amount is captured.</p>
            <li>
                <h3>Settle</h3>
            </li>


            <p>After two to four business days, the transaction that was captured has worked its way through the payment network and the merchant receives payment.</p>
        </ul>
    <h2>Voids and Credit</h2>

    <p>A <b>void</b> occurs after authorization, but before settlement. No money is exchanged, the authorization is simply cancelled. For example, let’s say the customer clicks Buy on the merchant’s website to purchase a product. The merchant then order the
        item to be shipped from the warehouse. However in the event that product is not in the warehouse, the merchant may choose to <b>void</b> the transaction.</p>

    <p>A <b>credit</b> occurs after settlement. Let’s say that the merchant ships the item, and the transaction is settled, but for some reason the customer becomes unsatisfied with the product. In this case, the merchant may decide to refund, or credit, the
        money. In this case a new transaction is created called a credit transaction. This transaction can reference the previous authorization, called a follow-on credit, or credit without the original authorization, called a stand-alone credit.</p>
